## Description

I love cats, that's why I created CatsGram. It's a fake Instagram, but it only displays cats. It's just a frontend version with a few features for mobile devices, built using the Vue.js framework with a fixed width.


## Technology
In my project, I wanted to showcase my ability to use CSS/SCSS and work with external APIs as well as local JSON files in Javascript/TypeScript.
I utilized only: Pure CSS, the AXIOS library for fetching data from APIs, and Icons from Bootstrap and Fontello.

Demo: https://catsgram-mobile.netlify.app/

###Actually Functions
- Home => It displays cat photos infinitely and allows opening 'relations' through the relations bar, which automatically close after 5 seconds. We can add heart beneath each post.

- Search => It displays 100 cat photos.

- MyProfile =>In the 'My Posts' section, it displays cat photos from a local JSON, while in the 'Pinned Posts' section, it showcases 10 random cat photos.

In the near future i add animations and many more.
